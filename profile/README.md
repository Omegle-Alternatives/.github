# 10 Omegle Alternatives That Won’t Make You Question Humanity

Miss the thrill of random chats since Omegle’s heyday faded? I get it—clicking "next" hoping for a gem amid the "ASL?" crowd is oddly addictive. There’s something about connecting with strangers online that keeps me coming back, even when half the chats feel like a time warp to 2005.

Luckily, **there are stellar Omegle alternatives out there with better features and safer vibes.** I’ve scoured the web, testing every random chat site imaginable to fight boredom (and the occasional lonely night). Some surprised me with quality connections; others left me side-eyeing humanity. Here’s my curated list of 10 options that won’t make you want to bleach your eyeballs—or might even restore your faith in people.

## How to Protect Yourself on These Platforms

Safety is key when chatting with strangers online. Here’s how I stay secure on Omegle and its alternatives:

### Always Use a VPN
I never hop onto random video chat sites without a VPN (Virtual Private Network). It masks my IP address and location, shielding my personal info from prying eyes. Without this, strangers could potentially pinpoint my location or exploit my network.

Look for a VPN with a **no-logs policy**—no activity tracking means extra peace of mind. Free VPNs often skimp on security, so I’d rather spend a few bucks monthly for solid protection.

My go-to is **[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/SH5kU)**—it’s fast, reliable, and the cheapest premium option out there right now.
